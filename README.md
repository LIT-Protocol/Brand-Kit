# Lit Protocol Brand and Media Kit (2023)

### Mission Statement and Summary
Lit Protocol is distributed cryptography for encryption, compute, and programmable signing. As a generalizable key management network, Lit provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools for managing sovereign identities on the open Web. Get started [building with Lit today](https://developer.litprotocol.com/SDK/Explanation/installation).

Lit’s goal is to enhance the security and functionality of decentralized applications (dApps) by:

1. Facilitating **interoperability between previously disconnected ecosystems** and platforms through blockchain-agnostic signing and encryption / decryption.
2. Enabling **private, permissioned, and truly sovereign data** on previously “public-by-default” networks.
3. Providing dApps with a more **seamless way to onboard their users** through the use of “web2 friendly” authentication schemes (such as Google oAuth, SMS, email, and Passkeys).
